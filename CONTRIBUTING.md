## Style Guide
We use the [Kotlin Style Guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) and ask that all contributors follow these guidelines. 
Your style will be checked on pull requests through `klint` and that check must pass for your pull request to be approved.

## Documentation
All submitted code must be self-documenting and, if API changes have been made, must have accompanying Java Docs. The Java Docs must be easy to
