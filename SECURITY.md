# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will continue to support all recent releases and make a pledge to continue our support for security and bug fixes. 
This is maintained software with on-going feature changes and you are expected to continually update to be on the latest supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a vulnerability please email `oss-security [at] mangostudios [dot] uk`. You must contain a detailed description of the vulnerability, 
the CVE code if valid and a demonstration on the replication. All vulnerabilities must be disclosed to us through email before going public. 

The email listed above will forward to two main maintainers of the project and a resolution will be discussed internally, 
under no circumstances report a vulnerability through an issue.
